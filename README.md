GPO Backup Script

Script will 
- backup all GPOs in domain
- create GPO reports
- csv report will all GP links and other very usefull informations
- WMI backup / export to txt file 
- keep the backups for rentetion period (default 10)

Recommendation is to schedule the task to run the script regularly directly on domain controllers as SYSTEM account.
